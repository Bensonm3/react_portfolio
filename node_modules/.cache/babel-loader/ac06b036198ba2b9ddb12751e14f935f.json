In the past year I have completed the Coding Boot Camp through the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education Dept, and am now looking to apply these skills in a new career. I like to spend most of my free time outside, usually either running or hiking. In the past couple of years I have gotten more into trail races, competing in several each year during the summer. The primary race distances I compete in are the 10K and half marathon. In the past few years I have gotten into rock climbing as well. I climbed the Tooth up at Snoqualmie pass this past summer, which required technical rock climbing skills and protective gear placements. I also enjoy traveling in my spare time, the most recent destinations being Costa Rica, Australia, and New Zealand.
